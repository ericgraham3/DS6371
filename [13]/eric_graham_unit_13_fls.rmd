# Question 1: Age, Weight, and Systolic Blood Pressure

## Scatterplot Analysis

* Age and weight appear to have a slight positive correlation (I can anecdotally confirm this).
* There appears to be a very strong positive relationship between age and systolic blood pressure.
* There appears to be a moderate relationship between weight and systolic blood pressure.

## Statistical Significance of Relationships

According to the SAS output, age and weight are statistically significant predictors of systolic blood pressure: the p-values for both slopes are less than 0.05.

## Equation of Regression Line

By plugging in the parameter estimates from SAS, we arrive at this regression equation:

$$\text{Blood Pressure (SBP)} = -28.0464 + 2.16095(\text{Age}) + 0.48969(\text{Weight})$$

## Interpretation of Coefficients

### Intercept (-28.0464)

This is the expected mean systolic blood pressure when both age and weight are zero. That isn't practically possible, but it's a parameter for our model. The high p-value (0.3251) indicates that this intercept is not statistically significant.

### Age (2.16095)

For each additional year of age, expected mean systolic blood pressure increases by approximately 2.16 units, holding weight constant. The p-value (0.0001) indicates that this relationship is statistically significant.

### Weight (0.48969)

For each additional unit of weight, expected mean systolic blood pressure increases by approximately 0.49 units, holding age constant. The p-value (0.0142) indicates that this relationship is statistically significant.

## Manual Calculation of Test Statistic

### T-Stat for Age

$$t_{\text{age}} = \frac{\beta_{\text{age}}}{\text{SE}_{\text{age}}} = \frac{2.16095}{0.47486} = 4.55$$

### T-Stat for Weight

$$t_{\text{weight}} = \frac{\beta_{\text{weight}}}{\text{SE}_{\text{weight}}} = \frac{0.48969}{0.18670} = 2.62$$

## Residual Analysis

* Normality: the histogram and qq-plot show an approximately normal distribution of residuals.
* Variance: the residual plot shows a random scatter of the residual values, with no clear pattern.
* Linearity: as with variance, the residual plot shows no clear pattern, which indicates that the relationship is linear.

# Takeaways and Questions

## Takeaways

* Polynomial regression can be used to model relationships that are not linear.
* Adjusted r-squared is the preferred metric for multiple linear regression models, as it accounts for the number of predictors (as well as sample size). But overrliance on adjusted r-squared leaves you open to overfitting (more on that below). 
* Including too many explantory variables can lead to overfitting, which makes the model less generally useful outside that data set.
* Isolating one variable while holding others constant can lead to a more accurate assessment of the impact of that isolated variable.determine whether additional variables improve the model.

## Questions

* I feel good about the async, looking forward to the lecture!
* I'm sure I'm not alone in being curious about the upcoming project!
